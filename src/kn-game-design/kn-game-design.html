      <p class="lead">Hell world is a third person science fiction horror game made to test a players senses. Inspired by games such as Dead Space and Slender: The Eight Pages, it combines gripping audio and visual effects to create a terrifying experience. But Hell World takes it to a whole different dimension... Literally.</p>

      <h2>Ideation and Brainstorming<br><small>Diverging and Converging</small></h2>
      <p>We started by sitting together and setting expectations for the final product. We then discussed a few themes and broke to come up with ideas for a game storyline. We used sources such as Behance projects, Pinterest etc to come up with concepts for the game. We played around with different ideas for the environment, character, motion/animation as well as physics. We also contemplated adding different effects like invisibity into the story line. We then got back together and discussed these ideas, expanded them to create basic storylines.</p>
      <p>These are some of the ideas we found most interesting:</p>
      <ul><li>Environmental game - Specifically, weird environments: 
        <ul><li>A world which is tumbling (like the inside of a cylinder, in Inception). Player needs to climb around.</li>
        <li>Upside-down world. Might mean player/ enemies walk around on their hands.</li>
        <li>Paradoxical architecture, like an infinite staircase or Escherâ€™s painting. Textures which make it difficult to understand exactly what surface the player may be walking on.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Puppet-based control / Indirect control: Multi-player game where each player controls one or more limbs of a giant robot as you attempt to fight the opponent without blowing up the city.</li>
        <li>Invisibility: Main character is invisible! Player needs to find himself. AIs are invisible! Finding ghosts or ghosts chasing the player.</li>
        <li>Parallel / Linked Worlds: Basically, have two areas where the physics are linked together. An object which exists in both is affected by surfaces in both, for example (and might be levitating in one of the two).</li>
        <li>Perspective: Some kind of ability to shift between 2D and 3D. A game where colors form surfaces and walls, and the player can change/manipulate colors to make them physical surfaces.
        Another game where the player can mix colors together, and some combinations are solid.</li>
        <li>Flying/Hopping Players.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We then narrowed down on creating a game with parallel worlds but with a horror theme. Hence HellWorld was born.</p>
      
      <h2>Game Play Design<br><small>"Whiteboarding"</small></h2>
      <p>We drew up basic plans for the game including sketches for the game enviroment in a white board session. We then assigned specific modules to each member of the team.</p>
      <img class="image" src="img/whiteboard.png">
      <h2>Development<br><small>Modeling</small></h2>
      <p>A We used Adobe Fuse to create the character. We then used animations from Adobe Mixamo to turn it into a complete model. We used assets from the Unity Asset store for the NPC. We added the AI for the NPC using Rain AI and additional logic. We created the environment using unity assets as well as custom builds using ProBuilder. We then developed the game win/lose scenarios as well as developed the environment switching logic. The next step was implementing the object interaction and light and sound effects to create the right game feel.</p>

      <h2>Alpha User Testing</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I was so fast. So fast. Also, how was I running for that long?"</p>
      </blockquote>                  
      <p>This was the most important step in our development process: Understanding how users felt about the game. We created an online survey with the game and asked players to fill out both a pre-game and post-game questionaire to understand both what gamers expect from a horror game as well as if Hell World satisfied their expectations. We then consolidated the results and worked out a plan to address specific areas of improvement. We found that most players felt that the difficulty level of the game was too low. Therefore, we worked on making the game harder, providing a more attractive game experience as well as creating a more appealing game feel.</p>
      <h2>Beta <small>Game Over</small></h2>
      <p>After the user testing phase we modified the game to better appeal to gamers and then added the finishing touches to the game including menu options, game controls for keyboards as well as controllers, etc. We added game objects to create a scenario that acts like a tutorial on start up. We then conduted a second playtest session to see if it met the expectations of gamers.</p>
